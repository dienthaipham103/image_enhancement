# image_enhancement
This repository contains the code of image enhancement. Image enhancement could be applied in many problems. In this project, we use image enhancement to improve the performance of segmentation model (Unet + DenseNet121). Instead of using orignial images as input of the segmentation model, we use enhanced images. It shows a better performance. The dataset we work with is coronary artery angiogram dataset.
